        <div><STRONG>Greedy Algorithm</strong></div>

        <div><STRONG>A greedy algorithm</strong> is any algorithm that follows
          the problem-solving heuristic of making the locally optimal
          choice at each stage[1]. In many problems, a greedy strategy
          does not usually produce an optimal solution, but nonetheless a
          greedy heuristic may yield locally optimal solutions that approximate a
          globally optimal solution in a reasonable amount of time.
